# travel-todo

A simple application for tracking destinations that you would like to visit

## Setup

Setup is easy! Make sure you have `node` (and, consequently, `npm`), and just run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install `react`, `flux`, and all the other goodness that powers `travel-todo`!

## Running the application

The application will automatically be served from `localhost:8080`. All you need to do is start it!

```bash
npm start
```

This will actually build the application from the source using `gulp` and `webpack`, among other things.
Any changes to the source will automatically be recompiled and rebuilt. If you use livereload, the page will
also automatically update!

To kill the server, you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

## Testing

Tests are run using [`jest`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). To run the tests, just do the following:

```bash
npm test
```
